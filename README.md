# Signal-Android

I changed some details in the code of the original Signal-Android-App.

The Changes are til now:
- It doesn't use the Google Play Services during the Registration
- It doesn't has to be updated every 90 days
- The color in the Chat is different (not white)
- The color in the Chatlist is different (not white)
- There are lines between the chats in the Chatlist
- There is no message that the app works in the background if you doesn't use the Google Play Services

I marked my changes with //todo

You can find the original Project at: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android


This is almost the same code as https://github.com/SBester001/Signal-Android. The only differenz is that I changed the name so that you don't have to uninstall the original app.
